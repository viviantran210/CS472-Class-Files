The Connection: Close version has a longer average runtime than the Connection: Keep-Alive version.
Both versions can have high variability (differences are both over 0.61 seconds comparing longest
time to shortest time). Keep-Alive was expected to perform better on average since it can reuse the 
same socket for multiple requests. However, there was a time when it took even longer than the longest
Close version runtime, which could be due to external conditions.
